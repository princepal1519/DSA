# Reverse Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an array of integers  **arr[]**. You have to reverse the given array.

 **Note:** Modify the array in place.

**Examples:
**

```
Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].
```

```
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [4, 5, 2]. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4].

```

```
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
```

        int n=arr.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n/2;i++){
            swap(arr[i],arr[n-i-1]);
        }
        
        
    }
