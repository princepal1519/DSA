# Middle of the Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return  *the middle node of the linked list*.

If there are two middle nodes, return  **the second middle**  node.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100

#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode | None) -> ListNode | None:
        slow=head
        fast=head
        while(fast != None and fast.next!=None):
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next       
        return slow 
```
